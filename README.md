= Date is fun with modern ECMAScript

This library extends Number and Date with some useful getters
and functions:

    (1).day.ago
    (2).weeks.fromNow
    (3).hours.since(Date.yesterday())
    (4).minutes.after(Date.now() + (1).day)
    (5).weeks.fromNow.atTheEndOfDay()
    (7).weeks.ago.atTheBeginningOfYear()

Read the code for more docs and have fun!
Bonus points for patches :)
